    <h1>What is the Furcula?</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to the Furcula (Wishbone)</h2>
    <p>Did you know that some dinosaurs had a special bone called the furcula, also known as the wishbone? It's like a tiny treasure hidden in their bodies! This bone was made by two smaller bones, called clavicles, joining together. But not every dinosaur had this wishbone, just some lucky ones.</p>
    <h2>Function of the Furcula</h2>
    <p>Picture this: some dinosaurs, like Velociraptor, Tyrannosaurus rex (the famous T. rex), and Archaeopteryx, had this cool bone called the furcula. Now, imagine this bone was like a superhero's tool belt, helping them move around better. In some dinosaurs, it might have helped with flying or keeping their balance while walking, just like a ninja's balancing stick!</p>  
    <h2>Furcula in Modern Birds</h2>
    <p>Guess what? Birds today also have this magical bone called the furcula! It's like finding a piece of a puzzle that connects the dots between dinosaurs and birds. Scientists believe that birds might have evolved from dinosaurs that had furculae. So, in a way, this tiny bone helps us understand the link between some dinosaurs, like the fierce T. rex, and the chirping birds we see in our backyards!</p>
