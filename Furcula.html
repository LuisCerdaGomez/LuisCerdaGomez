    <h1>What is the Furcula?</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In some dinosaurs, there was a bone called the furcula, which is also known as the wishbone. It's a special bone formed by the fusion (joining) of two smaller bones called clavicles. Not all dinosaurs had this bone, but some did.</p>
    <p>The furcula was found in dinosaurs like Velociraptor, Tyrannosaurus rex, and Archaeopteryx, which is considered one of the earliest bird-like dinosaurs.</p>  
    <p>Scientists think that the furcula might have helped these dinosaurs move around better. For example, in some dinosaurs, it might have helped with flying or balancing while walking. </p>
    <p>Interestingly, birds today also have a furcula, just like some dinosaurs did. This connection suggests that birds might have evolved from dinosaurs that had furculae. So, in a way, the furcula helps us understand the link between some dinosaurs and modern birds!</p>
