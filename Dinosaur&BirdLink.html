    <h1>Linking Birds and Dinosaurs</h1>
    <div class="dotted-line"></div>
    <h2>Wishbones (Furcula)</h2>
    <p>The wishbone, also known as the furcula, is like a special bone in birds that helps them fly. It's made by two bones called clavicles joining together. This bone is super important because it gives birds the strength they need to flap their wings and soar through the sky. But here's the cool part: some dinosaurs had wishbones too! Yup, it's true! Finding wishbones in dinosaur fossils tells us that birds and dinosaurs are kinda related. Isn't that mind-blowing? It's like finding out you have a family member you never knew about! Scientists study these bones to learn more about how birds evolved from dinosaurs and how they became the amazing creatures we see today. It's like solving a big puzzle about the history of life on Earth! </p>
    <h2>Feathers</h2>
    <p>Feathers are like the special signature of birds. They're what make birds look so unique and help them do amazing things like flying and keeping warm. But did you know feathers aren't just for birds? Yep, some dinosaurs had feathers too! Finding feathers on certain dinosaur fossils is like discovering a secret connection between dinosaurs and birds. It's like uncovering a hidden treasure chest in the history of life on Earth! Scientists study these feathers to learn more about how dinosaurs evolved into birds and how they adapted to their environments over millions of years. So next time you see a bird soaring in the sky, remember, it's not just a bird—it's a flying dinosaur! How cool is that?</p>
    <h2>Breastbones (Sternum)</h2>
    <p>The sternum, or breastbone, is like the central hub for a bird's flight muscles. It's kind of like the anchor that holds everything together, helping birds flap their wings and take to the skies. This bone is super important for birds because it gives their wing muscles something solid to push against, allowing them to soar high and swoop gracefully through the air. It's one of the many special features that make birds such incredible flyers! And guess what? Some dinosaurs had sternums too! Yep, even though they couldn't fly like birds, finding sternums in certain dinosaur fossils tells us more about how they moved and interacted with their environment. It's like peeking into the past and discovering the hidden secrets of these ancient creatures!</p>
    <h2>Wrist with a Crescent T-shaped Bone (Semilunate Carpal)</h2>
    <p>The semilunate carpal may sound like a mouthful, but it's actually a special bone found in a bird's wrist. Think of it like a tiny puzzle piece that helps birds fold and unfold their wings smoothly when they're flying. This bone is super important because it allows birds to have strong and flexible wings, making them expert flyers. But here's something really cool: some dinosaurs also had semilunate carpals! That's right, even though they didn't fly like birds, finding these bones in certain dinosaur fossils helps scientists learn more about how dinosaurs moved and adapted to their environment. It's like discovering a hidden clue that unlocks the mysteries of the past!</p>
    <h2>Hands with Three Fingers</h2>
    <p>Most theropod dinosaurs, which were these fierce meat-eating dinosaurs, had something really fascinating in common: they were kind of like distant cousins of birds! Imagine a T-Rex or a Velociraptor strutting around—they were actually related to birds in some ways. You see, theropods had a lot of bird-like features, like lightweight bones and three-toed feet. But here's the kicker: some theropods even had feathers! Yep, it's true! Finding feathers on certain dinosaur fossils tells us that birds didn't just appear out of nowhere—they evolved from dinosaurs! So next time you see a bird chirping in your backyard, remember, it's not just a bird—it's carrying on the legacy of its dinosaur ancestors! How cool is that?</p>
